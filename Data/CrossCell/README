### To train models and make predictions in a new cell line:
we need to remove the feature of test cell line from the training data and remove the feature of training cell line in the test data

### Train models:
./regForest -t train0_Gm12878.txt -o out/ -k1 -l10 -n20 -b prior_merge_Gm12878toK562.txt -d test0_Gm12878.txt

### Make predictions:
./regForest -t train0_Gm12878.txt -o crosscell/ -k1 -l10 -n20 -b prior_merge_Gm12878toK562.txt -d test0_K562.txt -s out/model/regtree_node
