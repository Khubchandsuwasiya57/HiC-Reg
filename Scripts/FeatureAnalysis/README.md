### Tree path analysis:
#### Usage:
```
./regForest_logcnt -t Examples/Data/Gm12878_chr17_WINDOW_train0.txt -o out/ -k1 -l10 -n20 -b Examples/Data/prior_window.txt -d Examples/Data/Gm12878_chr17_WINDOW_test0.txt -s Examples/out/regtree_node
```
#### Arguments (sames as regForest): 
- -t is the training data
- -o is the output directory
- -k is maxfactorsize (1 should be OK)
- -l is leaf size (e.g. 10)
- -n is the number of trees (e.g. 20)
- -b is the prior structure (potential regulators), see Examples/Data/prior_window.txt 
- -d is the test data
- -s is the prefix of saved models (e.g. Examples/out/regtree_node)


#### Input Files (sames as regForest)
1. training and test data genreated by Step 1: (tab deliminated)
```

```
header of training and test data should be the same.

2. prior_window.txt is a file to list the feature set used for training models, that is like this: (tab deliminated)
```
H3k4me1_E    Count
H3k4me1_P    Count
H3k4me1_W    Count
H3k4me2_E    Count
H3k4me2_P    Count
H3k4me2_W    Count
Distance    Count
```
Column1: feature set (header of column 2 to second last column) in training/test data, like H3k4me1_E, H3k4me1_P, H3k4me1_W, Distance.

Column2: Count (i.e. the header of the last column in training/test data)

#### Output Files:
1. testset_featureanalysis.txt (tree path rules)
```

```
- Column1: Pair of two regions
- Column2: genomic distance of the two regions
- Column 3 to n-2: feature rules for spliting the node, e.g. H3k27ac_W> (H3k27ac_W is used to split the node)
- Second last column (n-1): Predicted HiC Count for this pair for tree i in the log scale 
- Last Column (n): True HiC Count for this pair in the log scale 	


### Rules counting:
#### Usage:
```
./analyzePathv3 testset_featureanalysis.txt $level feature.txt outputfile
```
#### Arguments: 
- testset_featureanalysis.txt file generated by regForest_logcnt
- level: 1 or 2 (1 for individual feature analysis, 2 for pairwise feature analysis)
- feature.txt: features used in training and predictions (column1 from prior_window.txt)
- outputfile: output file, see testset_featureanalysis_f1.txt or testset_featureanalysis_f2.txt for example

#### Output Files:
1. testset_featureanalysis_f1.txt
2. testset_featureanalysis_f2.txt
